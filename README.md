# Patch-Match
Implementation of some papers for hole filling in pictures.

For the demo, please run the patch_match.ipynb notebook, located at ./hole_filling/.

If you want to use the algorithm with your own picture, pls use the file ./hole_filing/Create_hole.ipynb to create a hole in the right format.

# Matrix Completion
Implementation of some papers for Matrix Completion in pictures.

For the demo on images please run the MatrixCompletion.ipynb notebook, located at ./matrix_completion/

For the demo on video please run the denoisesimpleCV.py file, located at ./matrix_completion/
